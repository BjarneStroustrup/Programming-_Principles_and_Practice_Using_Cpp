  This widget produces an actual window.  This can either be a main
  window, with a border and title and all the window management controls,
  or a "subwindow" inside a window.  This is controlled by whether or not
  the window has a parent().

  Once you create a window, you usually add children Fl_Widget
  's to it by using window->add(child) for each new widget.
  See Fl_Group for more information on how to add and remove children.

  There are several subclasses of Fl_Window that provide
  double-buffering, overlay, menu, and OpenGL support.

  The window's callback is done if the user tries to close a window
  using the window manager and Fl::modal() is zero or equal to the
  window. Fl_Window has a default callback that calls Fl_Window::hide().

    Creates a window from the given size and title. 
    If Fl_Group::current() is not NULL, the window is created as a 
    subwindow of the parent window.
    
    The (w,h) form of the constructor creates a top-level window
    and asks the window manager to position the window. The (x,y,w,h)
    form of the constructor either creates a subwindow or a
    top-level window at the specified location (x,y) , subject to window
    manager configuration. If you do not specify the position of the
    window, the window manager will pick a place to show the window
    or allow the user to pick a location. Use position(x,y)
    or hotspot() before calling show() to request a
    position on the screen. See Fl_Window::resize() 
    for some more details on positioning windows.
    
    Top-level windows initially have visible() set to 0
    and parent() set to NULL. Subwindows initially
    have visible() set to 1 and parent() set to
    the parent window pointer.
    
    Fl_Widget::box() defaults to FL_FLAT_BOX. If you plan to
    completely fill the window with children widgets you should
    change this to FL_NO_BOX. If you turn the window border off
    you may want to change this to FL_UP_BOX.
