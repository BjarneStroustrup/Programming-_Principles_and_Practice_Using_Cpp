README - Fast Light Tool Kit (FLTK) Version 1.3.0
-------------------------------------------------

WHAT IS FLTK?

    The Fast Light Tool Kit ("FLTK", pronounced "fulltick") is a
    a cross-platform C++ GUI toolkit for UNIX(r)/Linux(r) (X11),
    Microsoft(r) Windows(r), and MacOS(r) X. FLTK provides
    modern GUI functionality without the bloat and supports 3D
    graphics via OpenGL(r) and its built-in GLUT emulation. It
    was originally developed by Mr. Bill Spitzak and is
    currently maintained by a small group of developers across
    the world with a central repository in the US.


LICENSING

    FLTK comes with complete free source code. FLTK is available
    under the terms of the GNU Library General Public License.
    Contrary to popular belief, it can be used in commercial
    software! (Even Bill Gates could use it.) 


ON-LINE DOCUMENTATION

    All of the documentation is in HTML in the subdirectory
    "documentation". The "index.html" file should be your
    starting point.  PostScript(tm) and PDF versions of this
    documentation is also available from the FLTK web site at:

        http://www.fltk.org/documentation.php


BUILDING AND INSTALLING FLTK UNDER UNIX AND Mac OS X

    In most cases you can just type "make".  This will run
    configure with the default (no) options and then compile
    everything.

    FLTK uses GNU autoconf to configure itself for your UNIX
    platform. The main things that the configure script will
    look for are the X11, OpenGL (or Mesa), and JPEG header and
    library files.  Make sure that they are in the standard
    include/library locations.  If they aren't you need to
    define the CFLAGS, CXXFLAGS, and LDFLAGS environment
    variables.

    If you aren't using "gcc", "g++", "c++", or "CC" for your
    C++ compiler, you'll also need to set the CXX environment
    variable. Similarly, if you aren't using "gcc" or "cc" for
    your C compiler you'll need to set the CC environment
    variable.

    You can run configure yourself to get the exact setup you
    need. Type "./configure <options>".  Options include:

	--enable-cygwin         - Enable the Cygwin libraries (WIN32)
	--enable-debug          - Enable debugging code & symbols
	--disable-gl            - Disable OpenGL support
	--enable-shared         - Enable generation of shared libraries
	--enable-threads        - Enable multithreading support
	--enable-xdbe           - Enable the X double-buffer extension
	--enable-xft            - Enable the Xft library (anti-aliased fonts)

	--bindir=/path          - Set the location for executables
                        	  [default = /usr/local/bin]
	--libdir=/path          - Set the location for libraries
                        	  [default = /usr/local/lib]
	--includedir=/path      - Set the location for include files.
                        	  [default = /usr/local/include]
	--prefix=/dir           - Set the directory prefix for files
                        	  [default = /usr/local]

    When the configure script is done you can just run the
    "make" command. This will build the library, FLUID tool, and
    all of the test programs.

    To install the library, become root and type "make
    install".  This will copy the "fluid" executable to
    "bindir", the header files to "includedir", and the library
    files to "libdir".
    
    To install additional files and icons to be used by the main
    desktop environments such as KDE, GNOME and XFCE, you will also
    need to run "make install-desktop" as root.


BUILDING FLTK UNDER MICROSOFT WINDOWS

    There are two ways to build FLTK under Microsoft Windows. 
    The first is to use the Visual C++ project files under the
    "ide/" directory.  See the file ide/README.IDE for more info.

    The second method is to use a GNU-based development tool.
    To build with the Cygwin or MinGW tools, use the supplied
    configure script as specified in the UNIX section above:

        sh configure ...options...
