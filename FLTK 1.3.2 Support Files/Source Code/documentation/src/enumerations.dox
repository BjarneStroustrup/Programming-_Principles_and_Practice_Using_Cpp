This appendix lists the enumerations provided in the
<FL/Enumerations.H> header file, organized by section.
Constants whose value are zero are marked with "(0)",
this is often useful to know when programming.

The Fl_Color enumeration type holds a FLTK color value.
Colors are either 8-bit indexes into a virtual colormap or 24-bit RGB
color values. Color indices occupy the lower 8 bits of the value, while
RGB colors occupy the upper 24 bits, for a byte organization of RGBI.

\subsection enumerations_color_constants Color Constants

Constants are defined for the user-defined foreground and background
colors, as well as specific colors and the start of the grayscale ramp
and color cube in the virtual colormap. Inline functions are provided to
retrieve specific grayscale, color cube, or RGB color values.

The following color constants can be used to access the user-defined
colors:

\li FL_BACKGROUND_COLOR - the default background color
\li FL_BACKGROUND2_COLOR - the default
    background color for text, list, and valuator widgets
