 \page	migration_1_1	Migrating Code from FLTK 1.0 to 1.1


This appendix describes the differences between the FLTK
1.0.x and FLTK 1.1.x functions and classes.

\section migration_1_1_color Color Values

Color values are now stored in a 32-bit unsigned integer
instead of the unsigned character in 1.0.x. This allows for the
specification of 24-bit RGB values or 8-bit FLTK color indices.

\c FL_BLACK and \c FL_WHITE now remain black and white, even if
the base color of the gray ramp is changed using Fl::background().
\c FL_DARK3 and \c FL_LIGHT3 can be used instead to 
draw a very dark or a very bright background hue.

Widgets use the new color symbols \c FL_FOREGROUND_COLOR,
\c FL_BACKGROUND_COLOR, \c FL_BACKGROUND2_COLOR, 
\c FL_INACTIVE_COLOR, and \c FL_SELECTION_COLOR.
More details can be found in the chapter \ref enumerations.

\section migration_1_1_cutnpaste Cut and Paste Support

The FLTK clipboard is now broken into two parts - a local
selection value and a cut-and-paste value. This allows FLTK to
support things like highlighting and replacing text that was
previously cut or copied, which makes FLTK applications behave
like traditional GUI applications.

\section migration_1_1_file_chooser File Chooser

The file chooser in FLTK 1.1.x is significantly different
than the one supplied with FLTK 1.0.x. Any code that directly
references the old \c FCB class or members will need
to be ported to the new Fl_File_Chooser class.

\section migration_1_1_functions Function Names

Some function names have changed from FLTK 1.0.x to 1.1.x in
order to avoid name space collisions. You can still use the old
function names by defining the \c FLTK_1_0_COMPAT symbol on
the command-line when you compile (\c -DFLTK_1_0_COMPAT) or in
your source, e.g.:

\code
#define FLTK_1_0_COMPAT
#include <FL/Fl.H>
#include <FL/Enumerations.H>
#include <FL/filename.H>
\endcode

The following table shows the old and new function names:

\section migration_1_1_images Image Support

Image support in FLTK has been significantly revamped in 1.1.x.
The Fl_Image class is now a proper base class, with the core 
image drawing functionality in the Fl_Bitmap, Fl_Pixmap, and
Fl_RGB_Image classes.

BMP, GIF, JPEG, PNG, XBM, and XPM image files can now be
loaded using the appropriate image classes, and the
Fl_Shared_Image class can be used to cache images in memory.

Image labels are no longer provided as an add-on label type.
If you use the old \c label() methods on an image, the
widget's \c image() method is called to set the image
as the label.

Image labels in menu items must still use the old labeltype
mechanism to preserve source compatibility.

\section migration_1_1_keyboard Keyboard Navigation

FLTK 1.1.x now supports keyboard navigation and control with
all widgets. To restore the old FLTK 1.0.x behavior so that only
text widgets get keyboard focus, call the Fl::visible_focus()
method to disable it:

\code
Fl::visible_focus(0);
\endcode
